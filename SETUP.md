# Setup Guide

Complete step-by-step guide to install Manki on a GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository
- A Claude Max subscription (or Anthropic API key)
- Repository admin access (for settings changes)

## Step 1: Repository Settings

### Enable GitHub Actions PR Approval

**Required** -- without this, the action cannot approve PRs.

1. Go to **Settings > Actions > General**
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions**
3. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
4. Click Save

### Branch Protection (Optional)

If you use branch protection rules and want Manki to be a required check:

1. Go to **Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules**
2. Edit the rule for `main` (or your default branch)
3. Under "Require status checks to pass":
   - Add `build` (CI check)
   - Add `review` (Manki check)
4. Under "Require pull request reviews before merging":
   - Set to 1 required review
   - The action's APPROVE counts as a review

> **Note**: If the action finds blocking issues, it posts REQUEST_CHANGES which blocks the merge. Non-blocking suggestions still result in APPROVE.

## Step 2: Authentication Secrets

### Claude Code OAuth Token (Max Subscription)

This allows the action to use your Claude Max subscription -- no extra API costs.

1. Run locally:
   ```bash
   claude setup-token
   ```
2. Copy the generated token
3. Add as a repository secret:
   ```bash
   gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN --repo <owner>/<repo>
   ```

**OR**

### Anthropic API Key (Pay-per-use)

1. Get your API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Add as a repository secret:
   ```bash
   gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --repo <owner>/<repo>
   ```

### Review Memory Token (Optional)

Required only if you enable the review memory system. This is a fine-grained PAT scoped to the memory repo only.

1. Go to [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
2. Configure:
   - **Token name**: `manki-memory`
   - **Expiration**: 1 year (or your preference)
   - **Repository access**: "Only select repositories" > select your memory repo (e.g., `<owner>/review-memory`)
   - **Permissions**: Repository permissions > **Contents** > Read and write
3. Generate and copy the token
4. Add as a repository secret:
   ```bash
   gh secret set REVIEW_MEMORY_TOKEN --repo <owner>/<repo>
   ```

## Custom Bot Identity (Optional)

By default, reviews appear as "github-actions[bot]". To give the review bot its own name and avatar, create a GitHub App.

### Create the GitHub App

1. Go to **Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps > New GitHub App**
2. Configure:
   - **App name**: `Manki` (or your preferred name)
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://github.com/xdustinface/manki`
   - **Webhook**: Uncheck "Active" (not needed)
   - **Permissions**:
     - Repository: **Contents** > Read
     - Repository: **Pull requests** > Read and write
     - Repository: **Issues** > Read and write
   - **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**: "Only on this account"
3. Click "Create GitHub App"
4. Note the **App ID** displayed on the app page
5. Generate a **private key** (scroll down > "Generate a private key")
6. Download the `.pem` file

### Install the App

1. Go to the app's settings page
2. Click "Install App" in the sidebar
3. Select your account and choose which repos to install on

### Add Secrets

```bash
gh secret set MANKI_APP_ID --repo <owner>/<repo>
# Paste the App ID number

gh secret set MANKI_PRIVATE_KEY --repo <owner>/<repo>
# Paste the contents of the .pem file
```

### Update Workflow

```yaml
      - name: Manki Review
        uses: xdustinface/manki@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          github_app_id: ${{ secrets.MANKI_APP_ID }}
          github_app_private_key: ${{ secrets.MANKI_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

## Step 3: Add the Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/manki.yml`:

```yaml
name: Manki

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted, dismissed]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  review:
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' &&
       contains(github.event.comment.body, '@manki')) ||
      (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review_comment' &&
       github.event.action == 'created') ||
      (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review' &&
       (github.event.action == 'submitted' || github.event.action == 'dismissed'))
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: manki-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number || github.run_id }}
      cancel-in-progress: true
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install Claude Code CLI
        run: npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
        env:
          CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
      - name: Manki Review
        uses: xdustinface/manki@v4
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
          # anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}  # Alternative to OAuth
          # memory_repo_token: ${{ secrets.REVIEW_MEMORY_TOKEN }}  # Optional: for review memory
```

### Event triggers explained

| Event | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `pull_request: [opened, synchronize]` | Auto-review on PR open and new pushes |
| `issue_comment: [created]` | `@manki` commands on PRs and issues (review, explain, triage, etc.) |
| `pull_request_review_comment: [created]` | Replies to review comment threads |
| `pull_request_review: [submitted, dismissed]` | Auto-approve check when reviews change state |

The `if` condition allows `issue_comment` events without the `pull_request` filter so that `@manki triage` works on nit issues (which are regular issues, not PRs).

### Concurrency

The `concurrency` block ensures only one Manki run is active per PR at a time. If a new push arrives while a review is running, the in-progress run is cancelled.

## Step 4: Configure Reviews (Optional)

Create `.manki.yml` in your repository root:

```yaml
# Claude model (default: claude-opus-4-6)
model: claude-opus-4-6

# Auto-review on PR open/update (default: true)
auto_review: true

# Auto-approve when all blocking issues are resolved (default: true)
auto_approve: true

# File filtering
exclude_paths:
  - "*.lock"

# Maximum diff size before skipping (default: 10000 lines)
max_diff_lines: 10000

# Team sizing: auto (default), small (3 agents), medium (5), large (7)
review_level: auto
review_thresholds:
  small: 200   # diffs under this many lines get a small team
  medium: 1000  # diffs under this many lines get a medium team

# Per-stage model selection (optional — falls back to `model` if not set)
models:
  reviewer: claude-sonnet-4-6    # fast, parallel reviewers
  judge: claude-opus-4-6         # precise, single judge

# Where to post nit findings: 'issues' (separate GitHub issue) or 'comments' (inline PR comments)
nit_handling: issues

# Additional context for reviewers
instructions: |
  This is a Rust project. Focus on ownership and error handling.

# Custom reviewer agents (added to the built-in pool)
reviewers:
  - name: "Protocol Compliance"
    focus: "DIP compliance, consensus rules"

# Review memory (requires REVIEW_MEMORY_TOKEN secret)
memory:
  enabled: true
  repo: "<owner>/review-memory"
```

See [`.manki.yml.example`](.manki.yml.example) for the full reference with defaults.

### Review pipeline

Manki reviews run in three stages:

1. **Reviewer agents** -- A team of specialist agents (security, architecture, correctness, etc.) review the diff in parallel. Each produces raw findings.
2. **Judge agent** -- A single agent evaluates all reviewer findings for accuracy, actionability, and severity. It filters out noise, merges duplicates, and assigns a 4-tier severity to each surviving finding.
3. **Recap** -- Deduplicated findings are posted as inline PR comments and a summary review.

### Severity tiers

The judge assigns one of four severity levels to each finding:

| Severity | Meaning | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `required` | Must fix before merge | Blocks approval (REQUEST_CHANGES) |
| `suggestion` | Should fix, but not blocking | Posted as inline comment, PR can still be approved |
| `nit` | Minor style or preference issue | Collected into a nit issue (or inline comments, depending on `nit_handling`) |
| `ignore` | False positive or irrelevant | Dropped silently |

Use the `models` config section to choose different Claude models for the reviewer and judge stages (e.g., a faster model for reviewers and a more precise model for the judge).

## Step 5: Set Up Review Memory (Optional)

The memory system makes reviews smarter over time by tracking learnings, suppressions, and recurring patterns.

### Create the Memory Repository

```bash
gh repo create <owner>/review-memory --public --description "Review memory for Manki"
```

### Seed Initial Structure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/review-memory
cd review-memory

mkdir -p _global
mkdir -p <repo-name>

# Global conventions (applied to all repos)
cat > _global/conventions.md << 'EOF'
# Global Review Conventions

- Prefer explicit error handling over silent failures
- Flag any hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Security findings should always be blocking
EOF

# Empty files for repo-specific memory
echo "[]" > <repo-name>/suppressions.yml
echo "[]" > <repo-name>/patterns.yml
echo "[]" > <repo-name>/learnings.yml

git add -A
git commit -m "chore: seed review memory"
git push
```

### Enable in Config

Add to your `.manki.yml`:

```yaml
memory:
  enabled: true
  repo: "<owner>/review-memory"
```

Make sure the `REVIEW_MEMORY_TOKEN` secret is set (see Step 2).

### How memory works

- **Learnings** -- Stored when you use `@manki remember` or when substantive review comment discussions are detected. Injected as context into future reviewer prompts.
- **Suppressions** -- Created by `@manki dismiss` or by leaving nit issue checkboxes unchecked during triage. Non-blocking findings matching a suppression pattern are filtered out (blocking findings are never suppressed).
- **Patterns** -- Automatically tracked from recurring findings. After 5 occurrences a pattern is escalated for visibility.
- **Global conventions** -- A `_global/conventions.md` file applied to all repos using the memory system.

## Step 6: Nit Issue Triage Workflow

When Manki approves a PR with non-blocking suggestions, she creates a GitHub issue with:

- A checkbox per finding (with code snippets and AI fix prompts)
- The `needs-human` label

To triage:

1. Open the nit issue
2. Check the boxes for findings worth fixing, leave the rest unchecked
3. Comment `@manki triage`

Manki will:

- Create a new GitHub issue for each checked finding
- Store unchecked findings as suppressions in memory
- Remove the `needs-human` label and close the nit issue

## Verification

After setup, create a test PR to verify everything works:

1. Create a branch with a small change
2. Open a PR
3. The Manki workflow should trigger automatically
4. Check the Actions tab for the review run
5. The PR should receive inline review comments and an APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES review

You can also trigger a review manually by commenting `@manki review` on any PR.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "spawn claude ENOENT" | Add the "Install Claude Code CLI" step before the action |
| "Failed to post APPROVE review" | Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" in repo settings |
| Review says "No reviewable files" | Check `exclude_paths` in config -- dotfiles are included by default |
| Memory not loading | Verify `REVIEW_MEMORY_TOKEN` secret is set and the PAT has Contents read/write on the memory repo |
| Review doesn't trigger on `@manki review` | The workflow file must exist on the default branch (main) |
| "Diff too large" | Increase `max_diff_lines` in config or split the PR |
| `@manki triage` does nothing | Make sure the `if` condition allows plain `issue_comment` events (not just PR comments) |
| Auto-approve not working | Check that `auto_approve: true` is set in `.manki.yml` and the `pull_request_review` event trigger is in the workflow |
| Inline comments land on wrong lines | The judge agent validated line numbers but the diff may have shifted. Findings that can't be placed inline are moved to the review body |

## Known Limitations

### `@manki review` runs action code from main branch

GitHub Actions runs `issue_comment` triggered workflows from the **default branch** (main), not the PR branch. This means:

- `@manki review` always uses the action code from main -- not from the PR branch
- If you're developing the action itself and want to test changes, use a direct push to trigger the `pull_request` event instead
- **The review content is still correct** -- the PR diff is fetched via API regardless of which branch the workflow runs on

This is a GitHub platform limitation that affects all Actions-based bots. Tools like CodeRabbit avoid this by using a webhook server instead of GitHub Actions.

### Reviews may post duplicate comments across runs

Each review run posts fresh inline comments. The recap phase deduplicates against previous findings, but if the judge agent fails or produces different titles, duplicates can occur. This is tracked in issue backlog.

## Quick Reference: All Secrets

| Secret | Required | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Yes* | Claude Max subscription auth |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes* | Anthropic API auth (alternative) |
