/**
 * Pick a verdict plus a machine-readable reason.
 *
 * Decision order:
 *   1. any surviving `blocker` finding → REQUEST_CHANGES / required_present
 *   2. any `warning` that is NOT a prior-round dismissed match → REQUEST_CHANGES / novel_suggestion
 *   3. any prior-round `warning`/`blocker` still unresolved → REQUEST_CHANGES / prior_unaddressed
 *   4. otherwise (only suggestions/nitpicks / previously-dismissed warnings / empty) → APPROVE / only_nit_or_suggestion
 *
 * A prior `warning`/`blocker` is "unresolved" when the author has not agreed to
 * dismiss it (`authorReply !== 'agree'`) and the underlying GitHub thread is
 * still in `openThreads`. A prior finding without a `threadId` is treated as
 * unresolved, which conservatively blocks APPROVE for older handover formats.
 *
 * The judge's `threadEvaluations.status === 'addressed'` is intentionally not
 * consulted here. That signal is LLM-derived and could be flipped by prompt
 * injection in prior-round source or comments, allowing an attacker to
 * unblock APPROVE on an unaddressed warning. Resolution must come from the
 * GitHub thread state (`openThreads`) or from an explicit author agreement
 * captured in `authorReply`.
 *
 * Multi-round priors are collapsed to one entry per fingerprint, keeping the
 * most recent round's `authorReply` and `threadId`. Callers must pass
 * `priorRounds` in chronological order. Without this dedup, a stale round 1
 * `authorReply: 'none'` would still match `.some(...)` even if round 2
 * captured an `agree` for the same thread.
 *
 * Contract for `openThreads`: callers must pass the result of a successful
 * GitHub thread fetch. Both `undefined` and `[]` are interpreted the same way
 * (no thread is open on GitHub), so any prior finding with a `threadId` that
 * does not appear in the set is treated as resolved. Callers that fail to
 * fetch thread state must abort before reaching this function rather than
 * pass a partial or empty list, otherwise unaddressed warnings could be
 * silently approved.
 *
 * Nitpicks and suggestions are non-blocking, and prior-round dismissed warnings
 * have already been acknowledged by the author. All these cases approve the PR.
