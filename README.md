<p align="center"><strong>Your tokens, your rules.</strong> Self-hosted AI code review that runs on your own GitHub runners and learns from your team.</p>

Manki assembles a dynamic review team sized to your PR's content and complexity. Dedup drops repeats from prior reviews, a judge filters noise and classifies what remains, and manki learns your team's conventions over time.

## Why Manki

- **Multi-stage pipeline** — a planner picks the team, agents review in parallel, dedup catches repeats from prior reviews, a judge filters noise and classifies findings by severity
- **Adaptive team sizing** — 1, 3, 5, or 7 reviewers chosen per PR based on content and complexity
- **Smart verdicts** — blocks PRs on real issues, approves over style nitpicks; auto-approves when all blocking threads resolve
- **Self-learning memory** — `/manki remember` teaches conventions, `/manki dismiss` suppresses false positives, patterns stick across PRs
- **Conversational** — reply to any review comment to discuss, or use `@manki explain`/`triage`/`forget` inline
- **Self-hosted GitHub Action** — your API key, your compute, no SaaS intermediary

## Quick start

1. **Install the app** — [github.com/apps/manki-review](https://github.com/apps/manki-review)
2. **Add a Claude secret** — `gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
3. **Add the workflow** — copy the YAML from the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md#step-3-add-the-workflow)

Full setup guide with memory, triage, and troubleshooting: **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**

## How it works

Manki wakes up when a PR is opened. A fast planner (Haiku) picks the team size and effort, reviewers work in parallel, dedup drops findings that match repeats from prior reviews, and the judge evaluates and classifies what remains. Results land as inline comments plus a summary and verdict. When all blocking threads resolve, manki approves.
