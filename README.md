<p align="center"><strong>Your tokens, your rules.</strong> Self-hosted AI code review that runs on your own GitHub runners and learns from your team.</p>

Manki assembles a dynamic review team sized to your PR's content and complexity. A judge filters noise, dedups against prior reviews, and manki learns your team's conventions over time.

## Why Manki

- **Multi-stage pipeline** — a planner picks the team, agents review in parallel, a judge filters noise, dedup catches repeats from prior reviews
- **Adaptive team sizing** — 1, 3, 5, or 7 reviewers chosen per PR based on content and complexity
- **Self-learning memory** — teach manki via `/manki remember`; it remembers dismissed findings and your team's conventions across PRs
- **Self-hosted GitHub Action** — your API key, your compute, no SaaS intermediary

## Quick start

1. **Install the app** — [github.com/apps/manki-review](https://github.com/apps/manki-review)
2. **Add a Claude secret** — `gh secret set CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
3. **Add the workflow** — copy the YAML from the [Setup Guide](SETUP.md#step-3-add-the-workflow)

Full setup guide with memory, triage, and troubleshooting: **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**

## How it works

Manki wakes up when a PR is opened. A fast planner (Haiku) picks the team size and effort, reviewers work in parallel, the judge evaluates each finding, and dedup filters repeats from prior reviews. Results land as inline comments plus a summary and verdict. When all blocking threads resolve, manki approves.
