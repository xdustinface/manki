# Manki

**Your tokens, your rules.** Self-hosted AI code review that runs on your own GitHub runners and learns from your team.

Manki assembles a dynamic review team from a pool of seven specialist agents, sized to your diff, then runs a deliberation round where every agent votes on every finding. She's curious, thorough, and remembers what you teach her.

## What Manki does

- **Dynamic review teams** -- A pool of seven specialist agents (Security, Architecture, Correctness, Testing, Performance, Maintainability, Dependencies) with automatic team sizing: 3 agents for small diffs, 5 for medium, 7 for large. Core agents (Security, Architecture, Correctness) always participate; additional agents are selected by content relevance
- **Deliberation voting** -- After the review round, every team member votes on every finding (agree/disagree/escalate). Majority-disagree drops false positives, unanimous-agree escalates to blocking, split votes become suggestions
- **Smart verdicts** -- Blocking issues get `REQUEST_CHANGES`. Nits get `APPROVE` with suggestions. Failures fall back to `COMMENT`. She won't hold up your PRs over style nitpicks
- **Review recap** -- On subsequent pushes, Manki deduplicates against previous findings and tracks which ones were resolved
- **Auto-resolve with validation** -- When a new push touches code near an open finding, Claude validates whether the fix actually addresses it and auto-resolves the thread
- **Auto-approve** -- When all blocking threads are resolved, Manki approves the PR. Trigger manually with `@manki check`
- **Nit issues for triage** -- Non-blocking findings become a GitHub issue with checkboxes, a `needs-human` label, code snippets, and AI agent fix prompts. Triage with `@manki triage`
- **Self-learning memory** -- Teach her with `@manki remember`. She stores learnings, tracks patterns, applies suppressions, and auto-escalates findings that are consistently accepted during triage
- **Conversational** -- Reply to any review comment to start a discussion. She reacts with emoji to acknowledge commands
- **No external dependencies** -- Runs on GitHub Actions with your Claude Max subscription. No third-party services, no external rate limits, no waiting in queue

## Talk to Manki

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `@manki review` | Trigger a full multi-agent review |
| `@manki explain [topic]` | Ask about the PR changes |
| `@manki dismiss [finding]` | Dismiss a finding (stored as suppression in memory) |
| `@manki remember <instruction>` | Teach her something for future reviews |
| `@manki remember global: <instruction>` | Teach globally (applies to all repos) |
| `@manki check` | Check thread resolution and auto-approve if clear |

## Configure

Create `.manki.yml` in your repo root:

```yaml
model: claude-opus-4-6
auto_review: true
auto_approve: true
exclude_paths: ["*.lock"]

# Team sizing: auto (default), small (3), medium (5), large (7)
review_level: auto
review_thresholds:
  small: 100
  medium: 500

# Teach Manki about your project
instructions: |
  This is a Rust project. Focus on ownership and error handling.

# Enable memory for self-learning
memory:
  enabled: true
  repo: "your-org/review-memory"
```

See [`.manki.yml.example`](.manki.yml.example) for all options.

## How it works

1. PR opened -- Manki wakes up
2. A dynamic team is assembled from the agent pool (3/5/7 agents depending on diff size)
3. All team members review the diff in parallel
4. A deliberation round runs -- every agent votes on every finding, majority rules
5. Clean review posted -- blocking issues get `REQUEST_CHANGES`, nits get `APPROVE`
5. Non-blocking findings become a GitHub issue with checkboxes and a `needs-human` label
6. On new pushes, Manki checks which findings were addressed, auto-resolves validated threads, and deduplicates before reviewing again
7. When all blocking threads are resolved, she approves
8. Comment `@manki triage` on a nit issue to convert checked items into work issues and dismiss the rest as suppressions

> Manki has a healthy appetite for tokens and a nose for bugs. She doesn't chase rate limits -- she chases rabbits.
