## Severity Assessment

Evaluate each finding on two dimensions:

**Impact** — How bad is it if this issue manifests?
- Critical: data loss, security breach, crash, broken core functionality
- High: incorrect behavior, silent failures, missing error handling that loses information
- Medium: degraded experience, confusing behavior, inconsistency, tech debt
- Low: cosmetic, style, naming, minor readability

**Likelihood** — How likely is this issue to actually occur?
- Certain: will happen on every execution of the affected code path
- Probable: will happen under common conditions or normal usage
- Possible: could happen under specific edge cases or unusual input
- Unlikely: requires unusual circumstances or rare conditions

**Severity mapping:**
- **required**: Critical/High impact + Certain/Probable likelihood, OR any Critical impact, OR patterns flagged as important in project memory
- **suggestion**: High impact + Possible likelihood, OR Medium impact + Certain/Probable likelihood
- **nit**: Low impact regardless of likelihood, or Medium impact + Unlikely likelihood
- **ignore**: False positives, intentional patterns, style preferences, reviewer misunderstandings

**Calibration note**: LLMs tend toward leniency when judging code review findings. Counteract this bias:
- When a finding is borderline between two severities, choose the higher one
- A finding that "could cause problems" under realistic conditions is \`required\`, not \`suggestion\`
- Only downgrade a finding if you can articulate a specific reason the issue won't manifest

Include your impact and likelihood assessment in the reasoning field (e.g., "Impact: High (silent data loss), Likelihood: Probable (happens on every error path) → required").

Examples of **required** (high impact, certain/probable):
  - SQL injection or unsanitized user input passed to any external system
  - Null/undefined dereference that will crash at runtime
  - Missing error handling that silently swallows failures
  - Logic error that produces incorrect results under common conditions
  - Breaking API change without migration path
  - Unchecked return value where the error is silently discarded
  - Resource leak (file handle, connection, listener) not cleaned up on error path
  - Race condition in concurrent code (shared mutable state without synchronization)
  - Missing input validation at a trust boundary (API endpoint, user input, external data)

Examples of **suggestion** (medium impact, or high impact with lower likelihood):
  - Error message lacks context that would help debugging (impact: medium, likelihood: certain)
  - Function could be split to improve testability (impact: medium, likelihood: N/A)
  - Missing timeout on HTTP request that could hang indefinitely (impact: high, likelihood: possible)

Examples of **nit**:
  - Variable name could be more descriptive
  - Inconsistent import ordering
  - Missing JSDoc on an exported function

Examples of **ignore**:
  - Intentional TODO with a tracking issue number
  - Known workaround documented in comments
  - Style preference that does not affect correctness

## Practical Reachability

For every finding, decide whether the failure mode it describes is **practically reachable** given the code you can see in this PR and the surrounding diff context. Classify into exactly one of:

- **reachable**: there is a concrete call site, input path, or execution flow visible in the diff (or the changed files it touches) that would actually trigger the failure described by the finding. Defaults here when in doubt about active code paths.
- **hypothetical**: the finding is technically correct about the code as written, but no caller, input, or control flow visible in the diff would exercise the failure mode. Typical examples: defensive guards on values that are always produced by trusted internal code, branches that cannot be reached with the current call graph, edge cases that would require the author to change unrelated code to trigger.
- **unknown**: you cannot determine reachability from the diff alone. Use this when the flagged code is exported or called from outside the changed files and you have no visibility into its callers.

Populate \`reachability\` on every finding. When you choose \`hypothetical\`, also give a one-sentence \`reachabilityReasoning\` explaining why no current caller triggers the failure — this is how the author audits a demotion.

Reachability is independent of severity. A finding can be \`required\` and \`hypothetical\`, or \`nit\` and \`reachable\`. Severity captures how bad the failure is; reachability captures whether it can actually happen today.

## Evaluation Criteria

For each finding, evaluate:

1. **Accuracy**: Is the finding technically correct given the code context?
2. **Actionability**: Can the developer fix this? Is the fix clear?
3. **Severity**: Based on actual impact, not the reviewer's original assessment.
4. **Reachability**: See "Practical Reachability" above.

## Guidelines

- Respect the project's review memory when calibrating severity. If the project has learned that certain patterns matter, keep findings about those patterns at higher severity.
- Trust reviewer severity unless you have clear evidence it's overstated or understated. The reviewers see the full code context, but may understate severity due to framing bias.
- When multiple reviewers agree, give their consensus significant weight.
- Use \`ignore\` for genuine false positives and intentional patterns only — not as a way to reduce finding count.
- If a reviewer flags something that looks intentional or is a matter of preference, mark it \`ignore\`.
- When downgrading a finding that multiple reviewers flagged, explicitly explain why in your reasoning.

## Reviewer Consensus

This review used ${agentCount} specialist agents. When evaluating severity, consider the proportion of reviewers who independently flagged each finding:
- **Majority or more flagged it** (${majorityThreshold}+ of ${agentCount}) — strong signal. Default to keeping the reviewer's severity. Only downgrade if you're certain it's a false positive.
- **More than one flagged it** (2+ of ${agentCount}) — moderate signal. Trust the severity unless you have specific evidence to downgrade.
- **Only one flagged it** (1 of ${agentCount}) — use your independent judgment. May downgrade or ignore if not convincing.

Multiple independent reviewers reaching the same conclusion is strong evidence that the finding is real. Downgrading a consensus finding requires explicit justification in your reasoning.

## Acceptance Criteria

If the PR description or linked issues contain acceptance criteria (checkbox items like "- [ ] criterion"):
- Check if each criterion is addressed by the changes in this PR
- An unmet acceptance criterion that the PR claims to implement should be flagged as \`required\`
- A partially met criterion should be flagged as \`suggestion\` with details on what's missing
- Acceptance criteria from the issue that are clearly out of scope for this specific PR can be ignored

## Duplicate Detection

Multiple specialist reviewers may flag the same issue independently. When you see findings that describe the same underlying problem (even with different wording, slightly different line numbers, or different titles):

- Return only ONE entry for the merged finding
- Use the best/clearest title from the duplicates
- Use the most detailed description
- In your reasoning, note which findings you merged (e.g., "Merged findings 1 and 4 — same issue")
