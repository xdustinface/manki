## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- Live-updating dashboard progress comment with text status lines
- AI-generated review summaries from judge agent
- Review event body with collapsed stats JSON for future analysis
- Progress comment as frozen audit log with review metadata (config, judge decisions, timing)
- Auto-detect GitHub App installation and use app token (`manki-labs[bot]` identity)
- `/manki` and `@manki-labs` command prefixes alongside `@manki`
- Token service authentication with GitHub Actions OIDC (no secrets needed)
- Judge validates PR scope — flags unrelated file changes
- Judge consensus weighting — multi-reviewer findings get more weight
- Judge acceptance criteria enforcement — unmet criteria flagged as required
- Judge impact x likelihood severity matrix (inspired by SonarQube)
- Dynamic consensus thresholds relative to team size
- Support for edited comments (`/manki` added via edit)
- Triage-created issues with proper prefixes and structured format
- Post-judge dedup pass for duplicate findings
- Logo added to repo and README

### Changed

- Action always exits 0 — event filtering moved inside, SIGTERM handled gracefully
- Concurrency group includes event name to prevent cross-event cancellation
- Nit issues redesigned with collapsible `<details>` and GitHub permalink embeds
- Inline comments use structured AI context JSON instead of duplicated "Fix prompt"
- All command responses restyled with `**Manki** —` branding
- Silent auto-approve (no visible message body)
- Default `models.reviewer` to Sonnet, `models.judge` to Opus
- `max_diff_lines` bumped from 10k to 50k
- Universal bot filter using `sender.type === 'Bot'`
- Removed `DEFAULT_REVIEWERS` — `AGENT_POOL` is single source of truth
- Team size label shows actual agent count
- README overhauled with logo, updated features, simplified config

### Fixed

- Code fences in nit issues render at column 0 for GitHub compat
- Triage parser matches new `<details>` nit issue format
- Serialize concurrent `ensureCLI` calls with shared install promise
- Remove blockquote from review summary, separate recap text
- `isReviewRequest` and `hasBotMention` support all command prefixes
- Bot self-triggering prevention for `pull_request_review` events
- Stale commit SHA guard for auto-approve
- Judge `required` severity bar loosened and calibrated with project memory
- Codecov checks made informational, then enforced at 95%
